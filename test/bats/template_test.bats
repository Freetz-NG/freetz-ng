# bats test worklow
# -----------------
# 1) each test file (.bats) is preprocessed. lines like @test "first test" {...} are mapped into native bash functions.
# 2) each test file is executed (1-n test cases) in a single process, hence it can be parallelized.
#
# bats test helper 'run'
# ----------------------
# "Bats includes a run helper that invokes its arguments as a command, saves the exit status and output into special 
# global variables, and then returns with a 0 status code so you can continue to make assertions in your test case."
# (https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core/wiki/Bats-Evaluation-Process, May 2022)
#
# bats internals
# -----------------
# "Anything written to stdout or stderr in setup, teardown, or a test function is captured by Bats. 
# If the test case fails, the error trap prints the output to the TAP stream as a comment. 
# Outside a test case, though, stdout is the TAP stream, so you'll want to specifically redirect any output to stderr."
