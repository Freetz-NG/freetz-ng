menuconfig FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS
	bool "binary-tools - Binary analysis and manipulation toolkit"
	default n
	help
		Collection of essential tools for analyzing and manipulating ELF binaries.
		Each tool can be selected individually to minimize flash usage.
		
		Total size when all selected: ~16MB
		Can be externalized to save flash memory.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_READELF
	bool "readelf - Display information about ELF files"
	default n
	help
		Displays detailed information about ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files,
		including headers, sections, symbols, and more.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_OBJDUMP
	bool "objdump - Display information from object files"
	default n
	help
		Displays information from object files, including disassembly,
		section headers, and symbol tables.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_OBJCOPY
	bool "objcopy - Copy and translate object files"
	default n
	help
		Copies and translates object files. Can be used to convert between
		different object file formats or modify sections.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_NM
	bool "nm - List symbols from object files"
	default n
	help
		Lists symbols from object files, useful for debugging and understanding
		which symbols are exported or required by a binary.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_STRINGS
	bool "strings - Print printable character strings"
	default n
	help
		Prints sequences of printable characters from files. Very useful for
		analyzing binaries and finding hardcoded strings.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_AR
	bool "ar - Create, modify, and extract from archives"
	default n
	help
		Maintains groups of files as a single archive file. Commonly used
		for creating static libraries (.a files).

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_RANLIB
	bool "ranlib - Generate index to archive contents"
	default n
	help
		Generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive.
		Used with static libraries created by 'ar'.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_STRIP
	bool "strip - Remove symbols from object files"
	default n
	help
		Removes debugging symbols and other unnecessary information from object files,
		reducing their size. Note: BusyBox already provides a 'strip' command.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_ADDR2LINE
	bool "addr2line - Convert addresses to file names and line numbers"
	default n
	help
		Converts addresses into file names and line numbers. Useful for debugging
		crash dumps and understanding stack traces.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_SIZE
	bool "size - Display section sizes in binary files"
	default n
	help
		Displays the sizes of sections inside binary files. Useful for understanding
		memory usage and optimizing binary size.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_BINARY_TOOLS_PATCHELF
	bool "patchelf - Modify ELF executables and libraries"
	select FREETZ_STDCXXLIB_FORCE_GNULIBSTDCXX
	select FREETZ_LIB_STDCXXLIB
	default n
	help
		Modifies existing ELF executables and libraries. Can change the interpreter,
		RPATH, and other ELF metadata.
		
		Useful for modifying binaries to use different dynamic linker paths or
		library search paths (RPATH/RUNPATH).
		
		Note: This tool requires GNU libstdc++ (will be automatically installed
		to /usr/lib/freetz/)
