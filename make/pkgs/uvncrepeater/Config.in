	help
		A IPv4 only linux port of the UltraVNC
		Repeater. The Repeater acts like a
		proxy, sitting in the middle between
		the UltraVNC Server and Viewer. All
		data for the session is passed through
		the UltraVNC Repeater meaning that the
		UltraVNC Viewer and UltraVNC Server can
		both be behind a NAT firewall, without
		having to worry about forwarding ports
		or anything else (providing the Repeater
		is visible to both UltraVNC Viewer and
		UltraVNC Server).
