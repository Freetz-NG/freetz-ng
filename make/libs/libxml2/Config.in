		Build libxml2 with all features enabled (--with-minimum=no).
		
		This includes additional XML features and APIs that may not be
		needed for basic XML parsing but are required by some applications
		like PHP for full functionality.
		
		Size impact: Adds approximately 200-300 KB to libxml2.so
		
		Note: Automatically enabled by PHP if full XML support is requested.
		Disabling will build a minimal libxml2 (--with-minimum=yes) which
		may cause compatibility issues with some applications.

	help
		Adds html parsing capability to libxml2. This increases the size of
		libxml2 by 120kB. Html parsing is required to build libxslt.
