		Build libxml2 with extended XML features (--with-minimum=no).
		
		This enables additional XML features and APIs beyond the minimal
		build, but does not include HTML support (see separate option below).
		Required by some applications like PHP for full functionality.
		
		Size impact: Adds approximately 200-300 KB to libxml2.so
		
		Note: Automatically enabled by PHP if full XML support is requested.
		Disabling will build a minimal libxml2 (--with-minimum=yes) which
		may cause compatibility issues with some applications.

config FREETZ_LIB_libxml2_WITH_HTML
	bool "Build with HTML support"
	default n
	help
		Adds html parsing capability to libxml2. This increases the size of
		libxml2 by 120kB. Html parsing is required to build libxslt.
